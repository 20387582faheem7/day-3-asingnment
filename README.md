Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery ensures customer satisfaction, reduces costs, and maintains competitiveness. Project managers can meet deadlines by:

Setting clear milestones and timelines.
Using project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).
Regularly tracking progress and addressing risks early.
Encouraging team collaboration and efficient resource allocation.
How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures financial sustainability and prevents resource waste. Strategies include:

Accurate budget estimation and planning.
Regular expense tracking and adjustments.
Prioritizing critical features to avoid unnecessary costs.
Using cost-management tools and methodologies like Earned Value Management (EVM).
Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Feature   	      Agile                       	           Waterfall
Flexibility-	Highly adaptable             	            Rigid, sequential
Development- Approach	Iterative (continuous updates)  	Linear (step-by-step)
Risk Management-	Early issue detection	                 High risk if changes arise late
Documentation-	Less documentation, more collaboration   	Detailed documentation
Best For	-Dynamic projects with changing requirements   	Well-defined projects with stable scope

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is ideal for software development with evolving requirements, e.g., mobile app development.
Waterfall suits projects with fixed scope, e.g., government software systems or financial applications.
Automated and manual testing.
Code reviews and peer programming.
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Maintaining quality ensures reliability, security, and customer trust.
What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Defining scope prevents project creep and ensures clear deliverables. A WBS breaks the project into smaller, manageable tasks, making planning and execution more efficient.
How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Ensures proper task sequencing and resource allocation.
Helps track progress and dependencies.
Gantt charts visually map tasks, deadlines, and dependencies, improving coordination
What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Clearly defining user pain points ensures the software solves real problems. Addressing inefficiencies, security risks, or user experience gaps makes the software valuable to its target audience.
A well-defined problem guides feature development, prevents scope creep, and ensures alignment with user needs. It helps teams focus on building a solution that directly addresses key challenges.
